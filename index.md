A03 Time Series Data Science in Health
Ben Smarr
1. That we could integrated data science interdisciplinary with Bioengineering students and
   use our expertise to help doctors with more efficient disgnosis and help patients and doctors to visualize data
   from different souorces and in a long term of time.
2. In order to protect our patients' personal information and health data, we are planning on making a registration
   and log in system, so that the patient could only view their own data and visualizations. However, due to lack of experience and
   needing technical support. We haven't able to get that part done and embeded it into our website. So I believe we need to pursue
   that for the Quarter 2 Project.
3. I feel like it will be more efficient to build a clear timeline, that on which date we are finishing which part, and we may need
   to clearer the boundary between our subgroups.
4. We are trying to build a could server, such as AWS, and store all of our data there. Also we are also trying to applying some of the
   log-in system to our websites and we need to learn how to encrypted the passwords and store all the usernames and passwords for each patients.
